ALx Task on AirBnB clone:
The project is designed to teach the concept of using a console to mangage data objects:
Below is the description of individual tasks
Tasks
0. README, AUTHORS
mandatory
Write a README.md:
description of the project
description of the command interpreter:
how to start it
how to use it
examples
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Docker’s AUTHORS page
You should use branches and pull requests on GitHub - it will help you as team to organize your work
1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
mandatory
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.
2. Unittests
mandatory
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
3. BaseModel
mandatory
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel

4. Create BaseModel from dictionary
mandatory
Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now it’s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
Update models/base_model.py:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
you will use *args, **kwargs arguments for the constructor of a BaseModel. (more information inside the AirBnB clone concept page)
*args won’t be used
if kwargs is not empty:
each key of this dictionary is an attribute name (Note __class__ from kwargs is the only one that should not be added as an attribute. See the example output, below)
each value of this dictionary is the value of this attribute name
Warning: created_at and updated_at are strings in this dictionary, but inside your BaseModel instance is working with datetime object. You have to convert these strings into datetime object. Tip: you know the string format of these datetime
otherwise:
create id and created_at as you did previously (new instance)

5. Store first object
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.

Now the flow of serialization-deserialization will be:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> JSON dump -> <class 'str'> -> FILE -> <class 'str'> -> JSON load -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
Magic right?

Terms:

simple Python data structure: Dictionaries, arrays, number and string. ex: { '12': { 'numbers': [1, 2, 3], 'name': "John" } }
JSON string representation: String representing a simple data structure in JSON format. ex: '{ "12": { "numbers": [1, 2, 3], "name": "John" } }'
Write a class FileStorage that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances:

models/engine/file_storage.py
Private class attributes:
__file_path: string - path to the JSON file (ex: file.json)
__objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects by <class name>.id (ex: to store a BaseModel object with id=12121212, the key will be BaseModel.12121212)
Public instance methods:
all(self): returns the dictionary __objects
new(self, obj): sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
save(self): serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing. If the file doesn’t exist, no exception should be raised)
Update models/__init__.py: to create a unique FileStorage instance for your application

import file_storage.py
create the variable storage, an instance of FileStorage
call reload() method on this variable
Update models/base_model.py: to link your BaseModel to FileStorage by using the variable storage

import the variable storage
in the method save(self):
call save(self) method of storage
__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
if it’s a new instance (not from a dictionary representation), add a call to the method new(self) on storage
6. Console 0.0.1
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:

You must use the module cmd
Your class definition must be: class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):
Your command interpreter should implement:
quit and EOF to exit the program
help (this action is provided by default by cmd but you should keep it updated and documented as you work through tasks)
a custom prompt: (hbnb)
an empty line + ENTER shouldn’t execute anything
Your code should not be executed when imported
Warning:

You should end your file with:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HBNBCommand().cmdloop()
Here is a brief explanation on how to use the console
it can be used in an interactive mode like this:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
it could also be used in a none iteractive mode like this:
echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
Note: the type in help to get a list of availaible commands e.g help
If you need help on a specific command, type help followed by the command name, e.g help create

7. Below is an overview of the available commands on the console
a. create: it takes the class name as argument and creates a new object based on that class
b. show: it takes the class name and its id as argument and displays a string representation of the instance of that class
	if it is available
c. destroy: it takes the class name and its id and it destroys the object of that class if it is available
d. all: it displays the string representation of all available instances
e. update: it takes the class name, id, attribute name and attribute value. It sets attribute in an instance of a class

8. Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel:

models/user.py
Public class attributes:
email: string - empty string
password: string - empty string
first_name: string - empty string
last_name: string - empty string
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of User.

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow show, create, destroy, update and all used with User.
9. More classes!
mandatory
Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel:

State (models/state.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
City (models/city.py):
Public class attributes:
state_id: string - empty string: it will be the State.id
name: string - empty string
Amenity (models/amenity.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
Place (models/place.py):
Public class attributes:
city_id: string - empty string: it will be the City.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
name: string - empty string
description: string - empty string
number_rooms: integer - 0
number_bathrooms: integer - 0
max_guest: integer - 0
price_by_night: integer - 0
latitude: float - 0.0
longitude: float - 0.0
amenity_ids: list of string - empty list: it will be the list of Amenity.id later
Review (models/review.py):
Public class attributes:
place_id: string - empty string: it will be the Place.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
text: string - empty string
10. Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.
